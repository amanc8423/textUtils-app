1. npm vs npx - npm is node package manager used to instal packages whereas npx also does the same thing but in npx we use it to use package for once without download for eg  create-react-app is a pakage to get basic structure pf react js we can also write all files by ourself but we want them all at once so we use npx because it will let us use crrea... package without downloading for only once
2. JSX (JavaScript eXtension) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that is used with React. It allows developers to write HTML-like code in JavaScript, making it easier to create UI components.
